Snawk
-----

Snawk is a snake implementation in `awk`. Because I could.

Run with `./run.sh`.

Use `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` followed by `enter` to move the snawk around. Hit
`ctrl`+`d` to exit.

Challenge
---------

I would love to make it run in realtime instead of hitting `enter` between
every move, but I couldn't find a way to do that using only tools that are as
ubiquitous as `awk`. If you can make that happen, a pull request would be most
appreciated (it needs to actually work, though. I have plenty ideas that does
half the job, but no complete solution).
